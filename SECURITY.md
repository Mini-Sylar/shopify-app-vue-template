# Security Policy

## Supported versions

### New features

New features will only be added to the `main` branch and will not be made available in point releases.

### Bug fixes

Only the latest release series will receive bug fixes. When enough bugs are fixed and its deemed worthy to release a new gem, this is the branch it happens from.

### Security issues

Only the latest release series will receive patches and new versions in case of a security issue.

### Severe security issues

For severe security issues we will provide new versions as above, and also the last major release series will receive patches and new versions. The classification of the security issue is judged by the core team.

### Unsupported Release Series

When a release series is no longer supported, it's your own responsibility to deal with bugs and security issues. If you are not comfortable maintaining your own versions, you should upgrade to a supported version.

## Reporting a bug
