# UPDATE Guide (v.1.0.x to v.1.1.x)

It seems Shopify has decided to fully deprecate the React Template. It's no longer available in the Shopify CLI. Meaning we no longer have to match the React template version.

As at `April 2024` Shopify has also deprecated a lot of the old APIs, Sadly, ProductCreate was also affected

It is now recommended to use `Shopify GraphQL API` for interacting with Shopify. See [Migrating From REST to GraphQL](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin/migrate)


To update your app to the latest version of the template, follow the steps below:

## 1. Update Dependencies

HINT: You can you use [npm-check-updates
](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) to speed this up

- Update the shopify app and cli to the latest version in [Root package.json](package.json)

```JSON
"dependencies": {
    "@shopify/app": "^3.58.2",
    "@shopify/cli": "^3.58.2"
  }
```

- Update dependencies in web folder [web/package.json](web/package.json)

```JSON
 "dependencies": {
    "@shopify/shopify-app-express": "^4.1.4",
    "@shopify/shopify-app-session-storage-sqlite": "^3.0.3",
    "compression": "^1.7.4",
    "cross-env": "^7.0.3",
    "serve-static": "^1.15.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.0",
    "prettier": "^3.2.5",
    "pretty-quick": "^4.0.0"
  }
```

- Optional: Update dependencies in `web/frontend` folder [web/frontend/package.json](web/frontend/package.json)

```JSON
"dependencies": {
    "@shopify/app-bridge": "^3.7.10",
    "pinia": "^2.1.7",
    "vue": "^3.4.21",
    "vue-router": "^4.3.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@rushstack/eslint-patch": "^1.10.1",
    "@vitejs/plugin-vue": "^5.0.4",
    "@vue/eslint-config-prettier": "^9.0.0",
    "eslint": "^9.0.0",
    "eslint-plugin-vue": "^9.24.1",
    "prettier": "^3.2.5",
    "vite": "^5.2.8"
  }
```


## 2. Update Imports
- In [Shopify.js](./web/shopify.js) update the import to use the new `shopify` APis

```JS
// other imports
import { SQLiteSessionStorage } from "@shopify/shopify-app-session-storage-sqlite";
import { restResources } from "@shopify/shopify-api/rest/admin/2024-04";
```

### 3. Optional
If using the `ProductCreate` mutation, See [Migrating From REST to GraphQL](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin/migrate) for the new way to create products, there's an example in [PRODUCTCREATE](./web/product-creator.js)
